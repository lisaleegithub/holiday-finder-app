                        You would be surprised how many different holidays there are around the world and some holidays are celebrated for days
                        which means the place you are traveling to could be either extremely quiet and empty or festive and crowded.

                        For example, some countries celebrate Lunar New Year while some countries don't.
                        Lunar New Year's Day is one of the most important holidays of the year in a lot of
                        Asian countries and it is for families to celebrate together.
                        A lot of businesses are closed for days during that time so it is best not to travel to those countries unless you have Lunar New Year plans.
